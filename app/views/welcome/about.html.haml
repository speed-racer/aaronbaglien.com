%h2 The Low Down

%p When I was 12 years old my dad, who had been a self taught programmer, tried to teach me how to program. I'm sure he would have better success with a brick wall. It was not something that I enjoyed, and it wasn't long before he started looking for a brick wall. I always enjoyed building things, but had a hard time wrapping my head around code. I chose construction for many years instead, and eventually moved to Brooklyn, NY and worked at a Printery/Bindery for 7 years. While there I eventually became a Line Foreman and ran a $1.3 million machine with an awesome crew. That was an great job and I learned a lot about Quality Control while there. I left Brooklyn for Florida to be near family and started working with a tree service, slight job change, and was with them for almost 9 years. My boss then, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Hedge-Hunters-Tree-Service/162672223757463">Patrick Smith</a>, is a <a href="http://www.isa-arbor.com/">Certified Arboriculturalist</a> and taught me everything I know about working with trees. He is a true professional and it was a great experience to learn from him, not just how to work with trees, but how to do a quality job. I really appreiated his attention to quality and detail. While working for him I was in a car accident in 2012 and while enjoying the field and excelling at it, it necessitated a job change. I started with Mathematica Policy Research out of Princeton, NJ, and worked for them as a Field Interviewer in Florida for almost a year. When we moved to Maine I continued as a Field Interviewer, but I was involved in their switch from laptops to iPads and in the process would communicate bugs with their programs to my oveseers. That's when I caugfht the QA bug.  It was shortly after that I moved into the field of QA Testing for Software. I have always been an avid gamer with a keen eye for glitches and bugs in software, and I was taught throughout all my various jobs to pay attention to detail and create quality products and services. So it seemed natural to enter the field of QA. Eventually I started learning how to not just find errors and bugs, but how to fix them too, and now I am learning how to program in multiple languages including, ruby, javascript, html/Haml, and css/sass.

%p Aside form work, I love spending time with my my wife Anna and our pups. We enjoy a variety of outdoor activities available in Maine, and whenever we can eating out in one of the best cities for foodies. I also have been a car enthusiast since I can remember. While I never really started digging under the hood of cars succesfully (in other words, actually fixing it instead of making it worse) till I was about 16, I always enjoyed the mechanics and beauty of a well designed car. I'm a big fan of the classics and love the designs of the the 1930's and 40's. In 2012 I bought a 1996 Impala SS, and while not a classic of the olden days, it is a car I have wanted since I was 14. It took me about 20 years to get one but it was worth the wait. While definitely not the fastest sedan on the block, she did pretty good in 1996, and you can't go wrong with an LT-1. Next car on my list is a Tesla Model S. Maybe this time it won't take 20 years. Also in my little bit of spare time I enjoy brewing (and drinking) craft beer. I am a big fan of craft brews espesially from breweries such as <a href="http://www.dogfish.com/">Dogfish Head</a>, <a href="http://www.northcoastbrewing.com/">North Coast</a>, <a href="https://lagunitas.com/">Lagunitas</a>, and our own local <a href="http://www.mainebeercompany.com">Maine Beer Company</a>.
