%h2 The Low Down

%p When I was 12 years old my dad who had been a self taught programmer, tried to teach me how to program. I'm sure he would have better success with a brick wall. It was not something that I enjoyed and it wasn't long before he started looking for a brick wall. I always enjoyed building things, but had a hard time wrapping my head around code. I chose construction for many years instaed, and eventually moved to Brooklyn, NY and worked at a Book Bindery for 7 years. While there I eventually became a Line Foreman and ran a $1.3 million machine with a crew of 7. That was an awesome job and I learned a lot about quality Control while there. After that I moved to Florida and started with a tree service, slight job change, and was with them for almost 9 years. My boss was a Certified Arboriculturalists, of which I also later became one, and it was a very professional service. He was one of the best bosses I ever worked for, and I really appreiated his attention to quality and detail. I was in a car accident in 2012 and I had to change jobs. I started with Mathematica Policy Research out of Princeton, NJ, and worked for them as a Field Interviewer in Florida and Maine for almost a year. When we moved to Maine I completed one last study with them and moved into the field of QA Testing for Software. I have always been an avid gamer, and I was taught throughout my careers to pay attention to detail and create quality products and services. So it seemed natural to enter that field of work. 

%p I have also been a car enthusiast since I can remember. While I never really started digging under the hood of cars succesfully(in other words, actually fixing it instead of making it worse)till I was about 16, I always enjoyed the mechanics and beauty of a well designed car. I'm a big fan of the classics and love the designs of the the 1930's and 40's. In 2012 I finally was able to get a car I wanted since I was 14, a 1996 Impala SS. It took me about 20 years to get one but it was worth the wait. While definitely not the fastest sedan on the block, she did pretty good in 1996. The next car on my list is atesla Model S. Maybe this time it won't take 20 years.
