%h2 A lone site in an internet wilderness...

%p I am a Quality Assurance Engineer and Software Developer for <a href="https://patdeegan.com">Pat Deegan PhD & Associates</a>, and also am a <a href="http://baglienconsulting.com">consultant</a> for companies to help them establish better TDD practices. My work focuses mostly on maintaining/updating/bug fixing code for the two primary products, CommonGround and <a href="https://recoverylibrary.com">RecoveryLibrary</a>, that are used by PatDeegan PhD & Associates. I also maintain our automated testing using Cucumber and Selenium. I enjoy taking a product someone has worked really hard on, and finding where it's broken. It's very rewarding to be able to help people make a better product that can help individuals in their progress toward recovery from mental illness. I like challenges and learning how to fix something that before I knew nothing about.

%p I currently live in Portland, Maine with my wife Anna, and office at a <a href="http://thinktankportland.com">coworking space</a> downtown. I am self taught and have used such learning tools as Design For Hackers by <a href="http://kadavy.net">David Kadavy</a>, and <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>. Since I was 12 years old I've been working in various jobs that have all taught me different lessons. From working in a pillow factory in South Dakotah as a teen, to being a Foreman for a $1.3 million bindery line in Brooklyn, to being a Certified Arboriculturalist in Florida for 9 years, I have learned the value of not only working hard and providing quality products, but also of good customer relations. Also I have appreciated providing services that contributes to the health of the community and individuals alike. I am proud to work for a company of disruptive innovators who create and disseminate care delivery methods and technologies to support the recovery of people diagnosed with mental illness.
