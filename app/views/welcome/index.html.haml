%h2 A lone site in an internet wilderness...

%p I am a freelance Quality Assurance Engineer and Frontend Developer currently working for <a href="http://www.theviaagency.com/">The VIA Agency</a>. Previously I worked for <a href="https://patdeegan.com">Pat Deegan PhD & Associates</a>. My work focused mostly on maintaining/updating/bug fixing code for two Rails SaaS products, <a href="https://www.patdeegan.com/commonground">CommonGround</a> and <a href="https://recoverylibrary.com">RecoveryLibrary</a>, and one Drupal product <a href="www.patdeegan.com">www.patdeegan.com</a>. I established and maintained their automated testing using Cucumber and Selenium. I enjoy QA work and the challenge of learning an entire product, refining it, and making it shine. I also enjoy the design aspect of Frontend work. It's very rewarding to be able to help a team make a better product that can support individuals in their progress toward recovery from mental illness. I like challenges and learning how to fix something that before I knew nothing about.

%p I currently live in Portland, Maine with my wife Anna, and our two dogs <a href="https://instagram.com/portlandpuggies">Vespa and Gir</a>. I work out of a <a href="http://thinktankportland.com">coworking space</a> downtown. I am self taught and have used such learning tools as Design For Hackers by <a href="http://kadavy.net">David Kadavy</a>, and <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>. Since I was 12 years old I've been working in various jobs that have all taught me different lessons. From working in a pillow factory in South Dakotah as a teen, to a Foreman for a $1 million bindery line in Brooklyn, to being a Certified Arborist in Florida for 9 years, I have learned the value of not only working hard and providing quality products, but also of good customer relations. I have appreciated providing services that contributes to the health of the community and individuals alike. I was proud to work for a company of disruptive innovators who create and disseminate care delivery methods and technologies to support the recovery of people diagnosed with mental illness.
