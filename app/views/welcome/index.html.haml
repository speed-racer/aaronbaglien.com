%h2 A lone site in an internet wilderness...

%p I am a freelance Frontend Developer and QA Engineer. I currently am working for <a href="http://www.theviaagency.com/">The VIA Agency</a> as a Frontend Developer. It's great working with a talented team to help create high quality products. Previously I worked for <a href="https://patdeegan.com">Pat Deegan PhD & Associates</a>. My work focused mostly on maintaining/updating/bug fixing code for two Rails SaaS products, <a href="https://www.patdeegan.com/commonground">CommonGround</a> and <a href="https://recoverylibrary.com">RecoveryLibrary</a>, and one Drupal product <a href="www.patdeegan.com">www.patdeegan.com</a>. I have experience in automated testing using Cucumber and Selenium and writing test scripts in Ruby. I like the challenge of learning an entire product, refining it, and making it shine. 

%p I have gained most of my experience on the job and have used such learning tools as Design For Hackers by <a href="http://kadavy.net">David Kadavy</a>, and <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>. I have built and contributed to several sites for company's including <a href="http://pcsquash.com">Portland Communituy Squash</a>, <a href="http://theviaagency.com">The VIA Agency</a>, Klondike, Perdue, and <a href="http://www.mainebeercompany.com">Maine Beer Company</a>. Throughout my various jobs I have learned the value of not only working hard and providing quality products, but also of good customer relations. I have appreciated providing services that contributes to the health of the community and individuals alike.
