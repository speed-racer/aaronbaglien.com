%p I am a Quality Assurance Engineer and Software Developer for PatDeegan PhD & Associates, and also do consulting for companies to help them establish better TDD practices. My work focuses mostly on maintaining/updating/bug fixing code for the two primary products, CommonGround and RecoveryLibrary, that are used by PatDeegan & Assoc. I also mainytain our automated testing using Cucumber and Selenium. I enjoy taking a product someone has worked really hard on, and finding where it's broken. It's very rewarding to be able to help people make a better product that can help individuals in their progress toward recovery from mental illness. I like challenges and learning how to fix something that before I knew nothing about. More to come...
