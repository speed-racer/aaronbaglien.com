%h1 Who am I?

%h5 I am currently contracting as a Quality Assurance tester for Pat Deeegan PhD & Assosiates. My work focuses mostly on automated testing using Cucmber and Selenium. I also am a QA consultant for hire. I enjoy taking a product someone has worked really hard on, and finding where it's broken. I enjoy being able to help people make a better product. I like challenging projects, learning how to fix something I know nothing about! I am also a junior developer, and web designer.
